# My first big project!

What I learned:

Javascript
- reinforced concepts of type conversion, switch cases, scope, etc.
- how to keep code more concise and readable 
- how to debug (use Javascript developer console, console.log)
- learned a lot about how Javascript interacts with HTML and CSS

HTML
- not that much, but I now know that you can assign more classes to one element

CSS
- not that much, creating this was pretty easy
- Flexbox is really intuitive
- learned how to make a button appear to be pressed

Algorithms
- I used pseudocode for every single thing in here
- this really helped a lot with making bigger problems into smaller ones, and I will be using this in the future

# Thoughts and what could be improved
- overall I'm really really happy with this project
- when the code didn't work, which was often, I didn't try to cheat and look up online solutions (of course, when I didn't know how f.e. how to use slice correctly, I googled the documentation)
- I kept composure and debugged until it worked, using pseudocode, etc. - everything about what The Odin Project thought me
- If I didn't know how to do a certain thing, I knew how to google to get the result

- I really don't like how I used switch cases for every button
- It seriously cluttered up the code, but every other block I'm very happy with
- I also wanted to add minor features like decimal support, keyboard support, but I also want to continue the course
